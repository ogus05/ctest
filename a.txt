Get started with our sample data sets

If you don¡¯t have any data for your MongoDB Atlas database, try our sample data sets. You can use these preloaded data collections to quickly get started experimenting with data in MongoDB.

Here are a few examples of what you can do with our sample data sets:
Calculate the average length of a bike share ride
Find the most popular vacation destinations
Run an aggregation pipeline to pick a fun film for movie night
To use the sample data sets, you must first create your Atlas database.
If you're not ready to create your Atlas database, learn more about sample data here.
